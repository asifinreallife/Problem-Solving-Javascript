//by function lierals we understand that we can create a function inside of a variable and then we can use that variable to invoke that function
//lets see
/*var addme=function(){//look this function don't have a name but it is created inside of the variable addme,now we will use add me
var myVal=arguments[0]+arguments[1];//since every function has its own array and we can access it by arguments
return myVal;
}
var result=addme(100,200);//see we have basically called a varible with two arguments
alert(result);*/
//above is the example of the function literals
//above code can be written like this too
var addme=((function(){
return (arguments[0]+arguments[1]);//it will return the value to addme variable
})(100,200));
alert(addme);//now it will work like same

//Anonymous functions are those who don't have a name suppose above function is one kind of anonymous function which did not have any name itself
//however the variable had a name,now lets create a function which has no name at all
//now we will call alert function and inside that we will create a function whose values will be printed but that function won't have any name

/*alert((function(){//a function is created inside alert function whose job is to just return a value which alert will print
return arguments[0]+arguments[1];
})(500,600));//we have passed the arguments here
