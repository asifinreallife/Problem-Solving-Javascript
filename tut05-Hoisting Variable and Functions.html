<script type="text/javascript">
//when javascript executes code whether it is inside of a function or not, it takes all the variable at the top of the function
//so whenever it encounters a varible later after executing some code,it gets confused and mark that variable undefined
//so good practice is we need to declare all the variables at first inside of a function lets see how
/*
(function(){
//no we will declare a variable
var num=5;
alert(num);//see it will work perfectly fine
})();
*/
/*
//above code works exactly fine but what will happen if we declare or even initialize the variable later??!! lets see
(function(){
//no we will declare a variable
var num;
alert(num);//now it will say undefined
//cause javascript took out the variable at first and it did not find any value of num cause we have assigned the value later
//it is called hoisting
num-5;
})();
*/
//however hoisiting occurs for variable but not for function
//even if we call a function first and create or define the function later in the code it will perfectly execute
//lets see how
//first we will declare an anonymous function and inside that function we will create another function
//we will fo it to check and call
(function(){
print();//we will create the print function later first we will call it and it will still work
function print(){
alert("See how funny it is that it still works");
}
})();
//above example worked cause javascript takes the function definition at the top of the compilation not the call
//so we have the liberty to create and call a function anywhere and we don't need to worry about it
